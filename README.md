# 📸 Memeify My Photo 🤣  

An AI-powered web application that automatically generates memes from user-uploaded photos by combining **computer vision** for image handling and **NLP-based text generation** for captions.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- Upload an image and instantly generate a meme.  
- Uses **Computer Vision (OpenCV/PIL)** to process images.  
- Adds captions using **NLP-based random text generation**.  
- Simple, user-friendly interface built with **Flask/Streamlit**.  
- Supports multiple meme styles (top text, bottom text).  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** OpenCV, PIL, NLTK/spaCy (for text), Flask/Streamlit (for UI), NumPy, Matplotlib  
- **Tools:** GitHub, Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab

## ⚡ How It Works  
1. User uploads an image.  
2. System detects image boundaries and places meme text appropriately.  
3. A random/funny caption is generated using an **NLP text generator**.  
4. The final meme is displayed and can be downloaded.

## 🔧 Installation & Setup  
```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/memeify-my-photo.git
cd memeify-my-photo

# Create virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv venv

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app
streamlit run app.py

```

## 📌 Future Enhancements  
- Add **AI-powered caption generation** using Transformers (GPT/HuggingFace).  
- Support for **GIF memes**.  
- Integration with **social media sharing**.
